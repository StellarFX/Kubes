## What is Kubes?

**Kubes** is a simple Minecraft server manager & creator. It was created using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), and powered by [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron). Its purpose is to facilitate creation of Minecraft servers locally, and provides a dark, clean user interface to manage these.

## Installation

As its experimental state, **Kubes** is (more or less) frequently updated in order to fix eventual bugs.
For now, only **Windows** is supported, and we plan to deploy this for **macOS** and **Linux**

In order to install, check out the [releases](https://github.com/SlyZ1/MSM/releases) page. We provide an installer, which you can use to install **Kubes**. We also plan to provide an auto-updater in our software!

## How to use?

Even if Kubes is quite simple of usage, we provide support to help users on our Discord!
